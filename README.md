# Last Online Bot

## Author

## Purpose
This is a discord bot that allows people to check when users were last online, since discord doesn't automatically provide that feature,
you can either search for one person, or display the status of everybody in the discord server

## Commands
Currently there are 5 commands that can be used
~~~~
`help
`ping
`status
`lastseen
`checkuser 'argument'
~~~~

## Instructions
If you plan on running the bot locally, you must set up an environment variable that contains the discord bot key (That only I have üòÅ),
Once all of that is setup, simply run the following command in the main directory of the program
~~~~
$ node .
~~~~

## Notes
- Currently the bot is deployed only on one server using heroku

## Purpose
This is a discord bot that allows people to check when users were last online, since discord doesn't automatically provide that feature

## Instructions
If you plan on running the bot locally, you much setup an environment variable that contains the discord bot key (That only I have :P),
Once all of that is setup, simply run the following command in the main directory of the program
~~~~
$ node .
~~~~

## Notes
- Currently the bot is deployed only on one server using heroku
